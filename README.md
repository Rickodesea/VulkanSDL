# VulkanSDL
Vulkan SDL Template

This is a template code base for implement Vulkan on SDL.  It was coded on linux but should
work on other platforms.  The code is meant for quick re-use (as is or freely edited).
It is written completely in C (hardly any C Vulkan tutorial out there) and the code is well documented.
