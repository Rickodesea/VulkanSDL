# Coding Style Guidelines

For the coding of this project, we follow these guidlines as much as possible:

* [C](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html)
* [C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
	* we use tabs as the preferred indentation
